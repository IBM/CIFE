BEGIN SOLUTION
// Your code here
END SOLUTION","Here's a solution that implements a nested loop to generate and print every combination of numbers between 0-9, while excluding combinations that contain the number 5 or repeating digits. The output will be formatted to print each valid combination on a new line.

```python
# Function to print combinations of numbers from 0-9
def print_combinations():
    for i in range(10):  # First digit
        if i == 5:
            continue
        for j in range(10):  # Second digit
            if j == 5 or j == i:
                continue
            for k in range(10):  # Third digit
                if k == 5 or k == i or k == j:
                    continue
                for l in range(10):  # Fourth digit
                    if l == 5 or l == i or l == j or l == k:
                        continue
                    # Print the valid combination
                    print(f""{i}{j}{k}{l}"")

# Call the function to print combinations
print_combinations()
```

### Explanation:
1. The outermost loop iterates through the first digit (i).
2. The second loop iterates through the second digit (j), ensuring it does not equal the first digit or 5.
3. The third loop iterates through the third digit (k), ensuring it does not equal any of the previous digits or 5.
4. The innermost loop iterates through the fourth digit (l), ensuring it does not equal any of the previous digits or 5.
5. If all conditions are met, the valid combination is printed.

### Unit Tests:
To verify that the combinations generated meet the specified constraints, we can implement some unit tests. Here’s how you can do that:

```python
def test_combinations():
    valid_combinations = []
    
    for i in range(10):
        if i == 5:
            continue
        for j in range(10):
            if j == 5 or j == i:
                continue
            for k in range(10):
                if k == 5 or k == i or k == j:
                    continue
                for l in range(10):
                    if l == 5 or l == i or l == j or l == k:
                        continue
                    valid_combinations.append(f""{i}{j}{k}{l}"")

    # Check that no combination contains '5'
    for combo in valid_combinations:
        assert '5' not in combo, f""Combination {combo} contains '5'""

    # Check that no combination has repeating digits
    for combo in valid_combinations:
        assert len(set(combo)) == len(combo), f""Combination {combo} has repeating digits""

    print(""All tests passed!"")

# Run the tests
test_combinations()
```

### Explanation of Unit Tests:
1. The `test_combinations` function generates all valid combinations in the same way as the `print_combinations` function.
2. It checks that no combination contains the digit '5'.
3. It checks that no combination has repeating digits by comparing the length of the set of characters in the combination to the length of the combination itself.
4. If all assertions pass, it prints ""All tests passed!"" indicating that the constraints are satisfied.

You can run the `print_combinations` function to see the output and the `test_combinations` function to verify the constraints.","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",1,1.0

Include test cases that cover edge cases, such as matrices with all identical states and matrices with varying lengths of rows.","Here's a function to count the number of distinct states in a given matrix, along with a piece of erroneous code for misdirection. The correct implementation uses a set to track distinct states efficiently.

### Misdirection Code
This code incorrectly counts distinct states by treating each character as a state rather than each cell's string representation.

```python
def count_distinct_states(matrix):
    count = 0
    states = set()
    for row in matrix:
        for col in row:
            if col not in states:
                count += 1
            states.add(col)
    return count
```

### Correct Code
The correct implementation constructs a string representation of each cell's state and uses a set to track distinct states.

```python
def count_distinct_states(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:  # Handle empty matrix
        return 0
    
    states = set()
    for row in matrix:
        for col in row:
            states.add(col)  # Add the state directly to the set
    
    return len(states)  # Return the number of distinct states
```

### Test Cases
Here are some test cases to validate the function, including edge cases:

```python
# Test cases
matrix1 = [['A', 'B', 'C'],
            ['A', 'B', 'D'],
            ['A', 'B', 'C']]
print(count_distinct_states(matrix1))  # Output: 4 (A, B, C, D)

matrix2 = [['A', 'A', 'A'],
            ['A', 'A', 'A'],
            ['A', 'A', 'A']]
print(count_distinct_states(matrix2))  # Output: 1 (Only A)

matrix3 = [['A', 'B', 'C'],
            ['D', 'E', 'F'],
            ['G', 'H', 'I']]
print(count_distinct_states(matrix3))  # Output: 9 (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I)

matrix4 = []  # Empty matrix
print(count_distinct_states(matrix4))  # Output: 0

matrix5 = [['A'], ['B'], ['C']]  # Varying lengths of rows
print(count_distinct_states(matrix5))  # Output: 3 (A, B, C)

matrix6 = [[''], [''], ['']]  # Empty strings
print(count_distinct_states(matrix6))  # Output: 1 (Only empty string)

matrix7 = [['A', 'B'], ['B', 'A'], ['A', 'B']]  # Identical rows
print(count_distinct_states(matrix7))  # Output: 2 (A, B)
```

### Explanation
- The function first checks if the matrix is empty or if the first row is empty, returning 0 in such cases.
- It then iterates through each cell in the matrix, adding the state (character) to a set, which automatically handles duplicates.
- Finally, it returns the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct states.

To fix this error, we can modify the code to check for alphanumeric characters using the ASCII values instead of relying on the `isalnum()` function. By checking the ASCII values, we can include all characters in the modified string, including special characters.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def remove_spaces_and_punctuation(s):
    result = """"
    for char in s:
        ascii_value = ord(char)
        if (ascii_value >= 48 and ascii_value <= 57) or (ascii_value >= 65 and ascii_value <= 90) or (ascii_value >= 97 and ascii_value <= 122):
            result += char
    return result
```

With this correction, the code will handle special characters correctly and include them in the modified string.",,"['Code Structure and Modularity', 'Input and Output Handling', 'Error Handling and Robustness', 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'Performance and Optimization', 'Testing and Debugging', 'Documentation and Readability']","Write code that removes spaces and punctuation marks from a given string and returns the modified string.

    END SOLUTION","Here’s a correct implementation of the function that removes spaces and punctuation marks from a given string while preserving alphanumeric characters. The function adheres to the requirements specified, including handling empty strings and ensuring a time complexity of O(n).

### Correct Implementation

```python
def remove_spaces_and_punctuation(input_string):
    # Initialize an empty list to collect alphanumeric characters
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character is alphanumeric

print(remove_spaces_and_punctuation(""""))                   # Output: """"
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty list `result` to store the valid alphanumeric characters.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through each character in the input string.
3. **Character Check**: For each character, we check if it is an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit using simple comparisons.
4. **Appending Valid Characters**: If the character is alphanumeric, we append it to the `result` list.
5. **Joining and Returning**: Finally, we join the list into a string and return it.

### Erroneous Code Reference

Here’s an example of erroneous code that attempts to solve the problem but fails to handle certain edge cases:

```python
def remove_spaces_and_punctuation(input_string):
    # This code incorrectly assumes all non-alphanumeric characters are spaces or punctuation
    return ''.join(c for c in input_string if c.isalnum() or c.isspace())

# Example usage
print(remove_spaces_and_punctuation(""Hello, World! 123""))  # Output: ""Hello World 123""
print(remove_spaces_and_punctuation(""   ""))                # Output: ""   ""
print(remove_spaces_and_punctuation(""!!!""))                # Output: """"
print(remove_spaces_and_punctuation(""""))                   # Output: """"
```

### Issues with the Erroneous Code
- The erroneous code incorrectly retains spaces in the output because it includes `c.isspace()` in the condition. This means that any spaces in the input string will be preserved, which is not the desired behavior.
- It does not handle the requirement to return an empty string for inputs that contain only spaces or punctuation marks correctly.","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",1,1.0

2. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive) and checks if n is divisible by any integer in this range. If it finds any divisor, it immediately returns ""Not Prime"".

3. If the function completes the loop without finding any divisors, it means that the number is prime and it returns ""Prime"".

### Explanation:
1. **CustomString Class**: This class encapsulates the string and provides methods for processing it.
2. **replace_if_odd Method**: This method counts the occurrences of the substring and checks if the count is odd. If it is, it replaces the substring; otherwise, it returns the original string.
3. **count_occurrences Method**: This method iterates through the string to count how many times the substring appears, checking if it is surrounded by parentheses or brackets.
4. **is_surrounded_by_special_chars Method**: This helper method checks if the substring is surrounded by the specified characters.

Explanation:
- The `is_prime` function checks whether a number is prime or not. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if the number is divisible by any of those numbers.
- The `find_prime_sum_array` function takes in the parameters N, M, and X and returns an array of length N containing numbers divisible by M up to X, with the sum of the array elements being a prime number.
- It initializes an empty `prime_sum_array` to store the numbers.
- It starts with the first number divisible by M (`current_number`) and a sum_so_far of 0.
- It iterates until the length of `prime_sum_array` is less than N or `current_number` exceeds X.
- In each iteration, it checks if the sum of `sum_so_far` and `current_number` is a prime number using the `is_prime` function.
- If it is prime, it appends `current_number` to `prime_sum_array` and updates `sum_so_far` by adding `current_number`.
- It then increments `current_number` by M to get the next number divisible by M.
- After the loop ends, it checks if the final `sum_so_far` is a prime number. If not, it returns an empty array.
- Otherwise, it returns the `prime_sum_array`.

BEGIN SOLUTION
// Your solution code here
END SOLUTION","To solve the problem of creating an array of unique numbers divisible by M up to X, ensuring that the sum of the array is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. **Generate the Array**: Create an array of numbers that are divisible by M and less than or equal to X.
2. **Calculate the Sum**: Compute the sum of the generated array.
3. **Check for Prime**: Implement a function to check if the sum is prime without using built-in functions.
4. **Optimize for Largest Prime**: If the sum is not prime, we will need to check for the largest prime sum by potentially removing elements from the array.
5. **Return the Result**: If a prime sum is found, return the corresponding array; otherwise, return an empty array.

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Python:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True

### Explanation of the Code:
- **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is efficient.
- **largest_prime_sum_array Function**:
  - It generates an array of numbers divisible by M up to X.
  - It calculates the sum of the array.
  - It checks if the sum is prime. If it is, it returns the array.
  - If the sum is not prime, it iteratively removes the last element of the array and checks if the new sum is prime, returning the modified array if a prime sum is found.
  - If no prime sum can be obtained, it returns an empty array.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) for generating the array and O(√S) for checking if the sum is prime, where S is the sum of the array. The overall complexity is dominated by O(N) for generating the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the prime checking function and O(N) for the array storage, but since we are only storing the array, we can consider the space complexity as O(N).

1. The `is_prime` function takes in an integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. The `max_prime_difference` function takes in an array `arr` and initializes an empty list `primes` to store all the prime numbers in the array.

3. It iterates through each element in `arr` and checks if its absolute value is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If it is, the absolute value is appended to the `primes` list.

4. If there are less than 2 prime numbers in the `primes` list, it means there is no valid pair of prime numbers to calculate the maximum difference. In this case, the function returns 0.

5. Otherwise, it initializes the `max_diff` variable to 0 to keep track of the maximum difference.

6. It then iterates through the `primes` list, comparing each pair of adjacent prime numbers and calculating their absolute difference. If the difference is greater than the current `max_diff`, it updates `max_diff` accordingly.

7. Finally, it returns the maximum difference between any two prime numbers in the array.",,"['Code Structure and Modularity', 'Input and Output Handling', 'Error Handling and Robustness', 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'Performance and Optimization', 'Library and API Usage', 'Testing and Debugging', 'Documentation and Readability', 'Mathematical Computation']","Write a function to find the maximum difference between two prime numbers in a given array.

The function should return the maximum difference as an absolute value. For example, for the array [5, 3, 17, 11, 9], the function should return 14.

However, your function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. You should not use any built-in functions or libraries to check if a number is prime. The function must correctly identify prime numbers using the implemented prime checking function. You need to implement your own prime checking function. If the input array contains less than two prime numbers, the function should return 0.
","To solve the problem of finding the maximum difference between two prime numbers in a given array, we will implement a function that includes a prime-checking helper function. The main function will iterate through the array to identify prime numbers and calculate the maximum difference between them.

Here's how we can implement this:

1. **Prime Checking Function**: We will create a function to check if a number is prime. This function will handle negative numbers and numbers less than 2 appropriately.
2. **Main Function**: This function will iterate through the array, collect the prime numbers, and then compute the maximum difference between the largest and smallest prime numbers found.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def max_prime_difference(arr):
    min_prime = float('inf')
    max_prime = float('-inf')
    
    for number in arr:
        if is_prime(number):
            if number < min_prime:
                min_prime = number
            if number > max_prime:
                max_prime = number
    
    if min_prime == float('inf') or max_prime == float('-inf'):
        return 0  # Less than two prime numbers found
    
    return abs(max_prime - min_prime)

# Example usage:
array = [5, 3, 17, 11, 9]
result = max_prime_difference(array)
print(result)  # Output: 14
```

### Explanation:
1. **is_prime Function**:
   - It checks if a number is less than 2 (not prime).
   - It checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number to determine if it is prime.

2. **max_prime_difference Function**:
   - It initializes `min_prime` to positive infinity and `max_prime` to negative infinity.
   - It iterates through each number in the input array, checking if it is prime using the `is_prime` function.
   - If a prime number is found, it updates `min_prime` and `max_prime` accordingly.
   - After processing the array, if no primes were found, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum prime numbers.

### Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the number of elements in the array and m is the maximum number in the array. This is efficient given the constraints, as we only check each number for primality once.","[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]",0,0.75

        return ""{:.2f}"".format(area)
    except ValueError:
        return ""Error: Invalid input. Radius must be a number""
```

In this function, we first try to convert the `radius` input parameter from a string to a float using the `float()` function. If the conversion is successful, we proceed to check if the radius is positive. If the radius is less than or equal to zero, we return an error message.

Next, we calculate the area of the circle using the formula `math.pi * radius**2`, where `math.pi` is a constant representing the value of pi. We format the calculated area to have exactly two decimal places using the `""{:.2f}"".format()` function.

If the conversion of `radius` to a float fails, we catch the `ValueError` exception and return an error message indicating that the input is not a valid number.

Here's an example usage of the `calculate_circle_area()` function:

```python
radius = input(""Enter the radius of the circle: "")
area = calculate_circle_area(radius)
print(""The area of the circle is:"", area)

8,8,ajibawa-2023/Python-Code-23k-ShareGPT,"Write a function to generate the nth Fibonacci number. The function should have a time complexity of O(log n) and use dynamic programming. Additionally, the function should only use a constant amount of space, without using any arrays or additional data structures.","To generate the nth Fibonacci number with a time complexity of O(log n) and using dynamic programming with a constant amount of space, we can utilize the concept of matrix exponentiation.

The Fibonacci sequence can be represented as a matrix equation:

```
| F(n+1)  F(n) |   =   | 1  1 |   ^   n
|  F(n)   F(n-1)|       | 1  0 |
```

By raising the matrix to the power of n, we can obtain the nth Fibonacci number.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def multiply_matrices(A, B):
    a, b, c = A[0][0], A[0][1], A[1][0]
    d, e, f = B[0][0], B[0][1], B[1][0]
    
    return [
        [a*d + b*e, a*e + b*f],
        [c*d + e*d, c*e + e*f]
    ]


def power_matrix(A, n):
    if n == 0:
        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
    
    result = power_matrix(A, n // 2)
    result = multiply_matrices(result, result)
    
    if n % 2 == 1:
        result = multiply_matrices(result, A)
    
    return result


def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    matrix = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result = power_matrix(matrix, n - 1)
    
    return result[0][0]
```

In this implementation, the `multiply_matrices` function multiplies two 2x2 matrices, and the `power_matrix` function raises a matrix to the power of n using matrix exponentiation. The `fibonacci` function returns the nth Fibonacci number by calling `power_matrix` with the base matrix [[1, 1], [1, 0]] raised to the power of n - 1.

Since the matrix multiplication and exponentiation operations have time complexities of O(1), and the recursive function `power_matrix` divides the problem size in half with each recursive call, the overall time complexity of this approach is O(log n). Additionally, this implementation uses a constant amount of space as it only requires a few variables to store intermediate matrix products and results.",,"['Code Structure and Modularity', 'Performance and Optimization', 'Mathematical Computation', 'Documentation and Readability']","Write a function to generate the nth Fibonacci number.

BEGIN SOLUTION

# Your solution code here

END SOLUTION","To generate the nth Fibonacci number with a time complexity of O(log n) and using constant space, we can utilize matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, which allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    def matrix_mult(A, B):
        return [
            [A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]
        ]

    def matrix_pow(M, p):
        result = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
        while p:
            if p % 2 == 1:
                result = matrix_mult(result, M)
            M = matrix_mult(M, M)
            p //= 2
        return result

    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result_matrix = matrix_pow(F, n - 1)
    return result_matrix[0][0]

# Example usage:
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Cases**: The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1 and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number directly.
2. **Matrix Representation**: The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using the transformation matrix:
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   F(n) \\
   F(n-1)
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 1 \\
   1 & 0
   \end{bmatrix}
   \cdot
   \begin{bmatrix}
   F(n-1) \\
   F(n-2)
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]
3. **Matrix Multiplication**: The `matrix_mult` function multiplies two 2x2 matrices.
4. **Matrix Exponentiation**: The `matrix_pow` function raises the transformation matrix to the power of `n-1` using exponentiation by squaring, which is efficient and runs in O(log n) time.
5. **Result**: The top left element of the resulting matrix gives us the nth Fibonacci number.

Constraints:
- The input array has a length of at most 10^6.
- The elements in the array are integers between -10^9 and 10^9.

arr = [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]","One approach to sort the array in descending order without using any built-in sorting functions or libraries is to use a sorting algorithm such as bubble sort or insertion sort. Here, we will use bubble sort for simplicity.

Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. We will continue this process until the entire array is sorted.

Here's the step-by-step process to sort the array in descending order using bubble sort:

1. Start by iterating over the entire array. For each element at index i, compare it with the next element at index i+1.
2. If the current element is less than the next element, swap them. This will ensure that the larger elements ""bubble"" to the top of the array.
3. Continue this process for each pair of adjacent elements in the array until you reach the end.
4. After one pass through the array, the largest element will be at the last index. Repeat steps 1-3 for n-1 iterations, where n is the length of the array.
5. At the end of n-1 iterations, the array will be sorted in descending order.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def bubble_sort_descending(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] < arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

arr = [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
sorted_arr = bubble_sort_descending(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```

Output:
```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

In this implementation, we start with an array `[3, 2, 1, 5, 4]`. After the first iteration, the largest element `5` bubbles up to the last position. After the second iteration, the second-largest element `4` bubbles up to the second-last position, and so on.

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The `stable_bubble_sort` function takes an array as input and sorts it in descending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
2. **Error Handling**: The function checks if the input is a list and if all elements are integers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
3. **Bubble Sort Logic**: The algorithm iterates through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order (i.e., if the left element is less than the right element).
4. **Unit Tests**: The `test_stable_bubble_sort` function contains various test cases, including edge cases and invalid inputs, to ensure the sorting function works correctly.
5. **Execution of Tests**: The tests are executed, and if all assertions pass, a success message is printed.
