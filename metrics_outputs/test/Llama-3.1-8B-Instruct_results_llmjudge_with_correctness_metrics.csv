955,bigcode/bigcodebench,"Generates and plots a complex wave with a specified amplitude and frequency over given time points, applying a Hann window to reduce edge effects. The wave is represented as a complex number where the real part is the cosine component, and the imaginary part is the sine component. It returns both the wave and the plot object.
Note that: Notes: The plot title is ""Complex Wave with Hann Window"". The x-label of the plot is ""Time"". The y-label of the plot is ""Amplitude"". The plot displays both the real and imaginary parts of the complex wave.
The function should output with:
    numpy.ndarray: The generated complex wave as a numpy array of complex numbers.
    matplotlib.figure.Figure: The figure object of the plot.
    matplotlib.axes.Axes: The axes object of the plot.

The system should handle different types of tenders, such as below-threshold, open UA, and open UA defense tenders. Each tender type has its own set of rules for transitioning between statuses based on the number of bids, complaints, and auction results. Additionally, ensure the system can handle unexpected input gracefully, such as invalid tender data or missing required fields.

The system should be able to:
- Transition a tender to 'unsuccessful' if there are no bids. This should be implemented as part of the rules for transitioning between statuses based on the number of bids.
- Set the auction period for tenders without bids, ensuring that this is handled correctly for all tender types.
- Transition a tender to 'qualification' if there is at least one bid, following the specific rules for each tender type.
- Handle complaints and transition tenders accordingly, ensuring that the system is robust against various complaint scenarios.
- Transition a tender to 'auction' when it's ready for auction, adhering to the defined rules for each tender type.
- Handle tenders with lots, including setting auction periods and transitioning lot statuses, as part of the overall tender management process.

Write a set of unit tests to verify that the system correctly transitions tenders and lots between statuses under various conditions, including edge cases such as tenders with maximum allowed bids and tenders with multiple complaints. Use the provided code snippet as a starting point for creating the test cases, and ensure the system provides clear feedback to users when a tender status transition fails due to validation errors. Additionally, implement logging for all status transitions to facilitate debugging and auditing.","**System Design**

BEGIN SOLUTION
<code>
    Utilize the pandas library's pivot_table function to create the pivot table.
    Ensure the function returns the pivot table as a DataFrame object.
    Verify that the aggregation functions used (sum for 'D' and mean for 'E') are correctly applied to the respective columns in the pivot table.
    Ensure that the numpy library is imported and used for the aggregation functions.
</code>","You can achieve this by passing a dictionary to the `aggfunc` parameter of the `pivot_table` function. This dictionary will map the column names to their respective aggregation functions.

Here's the solution:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(1)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A' : ['abc', 'def', 'xyz', 'abc'] * 3,
    'B' : ['A', 'B', 'C'] * 4,
    'D' : np.random.randn(12),
    'E' : np.random.randn(12)
})

result = pd.pivot_table(df, values=['D','E'], rows=['B'], aggfunc={'D': np.sum, 'E': np.mean})

print(result)
```

In this code:

- We create a dictionary `{'D': np.sum, 'E': np.mean}` that maps the column names 'D' and 'E' to their respective aggregation functions `np.sum` and `np.mean`.
- We pass this dictionary to the `aggfunc` parameter of the `pivot_table` function.
- The `pivot_table` function will apply the specified aggregation functions to the respective columns in the pivot table.

This will produce a pivot table where the values in column 'D' are summed and the values in column 'E' are averaged.","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",Partially Correct,"The code is syntactically correct and logically applies different aggregation functions to different columns in the pivot table as requested. However, the parameter 'rows' used in pd.pivot_table is deprecated and should be replaced with 'index'. Despite this, the code will still run with a warning in recent pandas versions, so it is semantically correct. The code satisfies the constraint of producing a pivot table with sum for 'D' and mean for 'E'.",1,1.0

</code>","To efficiently combine the dataframes based on timestamps without looping through every row of df2, you can utilize the pandas `merge_asof` function. Here's the solution:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create dataframes
df1 = pd.DataFrame({'Timestamp': ['2019/04/02 11:00:01', '2019/04/02 11:00:15', '2019/04/02 11:00:29', '2019/04/02 11:00:30'],

                    'stuff': [101, 202, 303, 404, 505]})

# Convert Timestamp to datetime
df1['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df1['Timestamp'])
df2['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df2['Timestamp'])

# Merge df1 and df2 using merge_asof
result = pd.merge_asof(df2, df1, on='Timestamp', direction='forward')

# Fill NaN values in 'data' column with None
result['data'] = result['data'].fillna(None)

# Reorder columns to match the original order of df2
result = result[['Timestamp', 'stuff', 'data']]

print(result)
```

This solution will output:

However, the merge_asof is used with direction='forward', which means it matches the next row in df1 with a Timestamp greater than or equal to df2's Timestamp. The problem requires for each df2 Timestamp to get the df1 data at that particular time or the closest previous time (as shown in the example). The example output shows that for Timestamp 2019/04/02 11:00:14 in df2, the data from df1 at 2019/04/02 11:00:15 (222) is used, which is a forward match, so direction='forward' is correct. But for 2019/04/02 11:00:16 in df2, the data from df1 at 2019/04/02 11:00:29 (333) is used, which is a forward match as well. So direction='forward' matches the example.

342,ajibawa-2023/Python-Code-23k-ShareGPT,"Create a function to compute the area of a triangle when the length of its three sides are known. The sides of the triangle are represented by the variables a, b, and c.

The function should first check if the given sides can form a valid triangle. If the sides cannot form a valid triangle, the function should raise a custom exception called `InvalidTriangleError` with the message ""Invalid triangle: the given sides cannot form a triangle.""

To check if the sides can form a valid triangle, you should use the following conditions:
- The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.
- The difference between the length of any two sides of a triangle must be smaller than the length of the third side.
- Additionally, the sides of the triangle must be integers.

If the given sides can form a valid triangle, your function should compute and return the area of the triangle using the same Heron's formula provided in the previous test.

To summarize:
- Write a function called `compute_triangle_area` that takes in three parameters: a, b, and c.
- Check if the given sides can form a valid triangle using the conditions stated above. If not, raise an `InvalidTriangleError` with the message ""Invalid triangle: the given sides cannot form a triangle.""
- If the sides can form a valid triangle, compute and return the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.

    print(area)  # Output: 24
except InvalidTriangleError as e:

Hints:
- You can use the math.sqrt() function from the math module to compute the square root.
- Make sure to handle the case where the sides cannot form a valid triangle by raising the custom exception.
- You may assume that the given side lengths are positive integers.
- Remember to check if the sides are integers in addition to the existing conditions.","Here's the implementation of the `compute_triangle_area` function:

    # Check if the given sides can form a triangle
    if a + b <= c or b + c <= a or a + c <= b:

```

This function works by iterating over each character in the string. It keeps track of the current character position using an index variable. When it encounters a non-whitespace character, it increments the index. If the index reaches 3, it returns the current character. This approach ensures that the function uses a single loop iteration and handles cases where the input string has leading or trailing whitespace characters.","[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",Partially Correct,"The code has no syntax errors and logically attempts to return the third non-whitespace character. However, it does not correctly remove leading and trailing whitespace before indexing; instead, it skips all spaces anywhere in the string, which is incorrect. The instruction requires removing leading and trailing whitespace first, then returning the third character of the trimmed string. Also, the code only skips spaces (' '), not all whitespace characters, which may violate the requirement. Therefore, it does not satisfy the constraint correctly.",1,1.0
