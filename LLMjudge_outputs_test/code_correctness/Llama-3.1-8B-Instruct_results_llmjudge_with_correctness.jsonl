Linked List Cycle II\n\n#### Problem Description\n\nGiven the `head` of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`. To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.\n\n#### Solution\n\n```python\n# Definition for singly-linked list.\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.next = None\n\nclass Solution:\n    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n        \"\"\"\n        Detects the node where the cycle begins in a linked list.\n\n        Args:\n        head (ListNode): The head of the linked list.\n\n        Returns:\n        ListNode: The node where the cycle begins, or None if there is no cycle.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Check if the input is valid\n        if not head or not head.next:\n            return None\n\n        # Phase 1: Detecting the cycle using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm\n        tortoise = head\n        hare = head\n        while hare and hare.next:\n            tortoise = tortoise.next\n            hare = hare.next.next\n            if tortoise == hare:\n                break\n\n        # If there is no cycle, return None\n        if not hare or not hare.next:\n            return None\n\n        # Phase 2: Finding the start of the cycle\n        tortoise = head\n        while tortoise != hare:\n            tortoise = tortoise.next\n            hare = hare.next\n\n        return tortoise\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\nThe solution uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect the cycle in the linked list. The algorithm works by moving two pointers at different speeds through the list. If there is a cycle, the faster pointer will eventually catch up to the slower pointer.\n\nOnce the cycle is detected, we reset the slower pointer to the head of the list and move both pointers one step at a time. The point where they meet again is the start of the cycle.\n\n#### Test Cases\n\n```python\ndef test_detect_cycle():\n    # Test case 1: A linked list with a cycle\n    head = ListNode(3)\n    head.next = ListNode(2)\n    head.next.next = ListNode(0)\n    head.next.next.next = ListNode(-4)\n    head.next.next.next.next = head.next  # Create a cycle\n    solution = Solution()\n    result = solution.detectCycle(head)\n    assert result.val == 2\n\n    # Test case 2: A linked list without a cycle\n    head = ListNode(1)\n    head.next = ListNode(2)\n    head.next.next = ListNode(3)\n    solution = Solution()\n    result = solution.detectCycle(head)\n    assert result is None\n\n    # Test case 3: An empty linked list\n    head = None\n    solution = Solution()\n    result = solution.detectCycle(head)\n    assert result is None\n\n    # Test case 4: A linked list with a single node\n    head = ListNode(1)\n    solution = Solution()\n    result = solution.detectCycle(head)\n    assert result is None\n\ntest_detect_cycle()\n```\n\n#### Follow-up: O(1) Memory Solution\n\nTo solve the problem using O(1) memory, we can use the concept of \"hashing\" to keep track of the nodes we have visited. However, this approach would require modifying the linked list, which is not allowed according to the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the O(1) memory solution is not possible using the two-pointer technique. However, we can use a different approach, such as using a set to keep track of the nodes we have visited, which would require O(n) space.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"Return the node where the cycle begins.\", \"Reason\": \"The function detectCycle returns the node where the cycle begins if a cycle exists, as demonstrated by returning 'tortoise' which is the start of the cycle.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Return null if there is no cycle.\", \"Reason\": \"The function returns None (Python's null equivalent) when no cycle is detected, as shown by returning None in cases where hare or hare.next is None.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Use an integer pos to represent the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to.\", \"Reason\": \"The code and tests do not explicitly use or handle an integer 'pos' to represent the cycle position; the cycle is created manually by linking nodes directly in the test cases.\", \"Aligns\": false}, {\"Constraint\": \"If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.\", \"Reason\": \"Since 'pos' is not used or referenced in the code or tests, this constraint is not explicitly addressed.\", \"Aligns\": false}, {\"Constraint\": \"Do not modify the linked list.\", \"Reason\": \"The solution does not modify the linked list structure during detection; it only traverses nodes using pointers.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Solve it using O(1) (i.e., constant) memory.\", \"Reason\": \"The implementation uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm which uses only two pointers and constant extra space.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Implement the cycle detection algorithm using a two-pointer technique to ensure clarity and efficiency.\", \"Reason\": \"The code uses two pointers named 'tortoise' and 'hare' moving at different speeds, which is the two-pointer technique.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Include test cases that cover edge cases, such as an empty list and a single node without a cycle.\", \"Reason\": \"The test cases include an empty list (head = None) and a single node without a cycle, covering these edge cases.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Provide clear comments in the code to explain the logic behind the cycle detection algorithm.\", \"Reason\": \"The code includes comments explaining the phases of the algorithm and the logic behind cycle detection.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Ensure the function handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as passing a non-ListNode object as head.\", \"Reason\": \"The function checks if head or head.next is falsy but does not explicitly check for invalid types (e.g., non-ListNode objects).

The `students` field should create a many-to-many relationship with the `SchoolProfile` model, and the related name should be 'classrooms'.\n5. The `teacher` field should create a one-to-one relationship with the `SchoolProfile` model, and the related name should be 'teacher_classroom'.\n6. The unique constraint on the combination of `school` and `class_name` should be enforced, meaning you cannot have two `ClassRoom` instances with the same `school` and `class_name`.\n\nTo verify the migration, you can run the following commands in your Django project:\n\n```shell\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\nThen, you can use the Django shell to test the constraints:\n\n```shell\npython manage.py shell\n```\n\nInside the shell, you can try creating `ClassRoom` instances and check if the constraints are applied:\n\n```python\nfrom quiz.models import School, SchoolProfile, ClassRoom\n\n# Assuming School and SchoolProfile instances already exist\nschool = School.objects.first()\nteacher = SchoolProfile.objects.first()\n\n# Create a ClassRoom instance\nclassroom = ClassRoom.objects.create(class_name='Math 101', school=school, teacher=teacher)\n\n# Try to create another ClassRoom with the same school and class_name\ntry:\n    duplicate_classroom = ClassRoom.objects.create(class_name='Math 101', school=school, teacher=teacher)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(e)  # This should raise an exception due to the unique constraint\n```","test":null,"relevant_categories":"['Code Structure and Modularity', 'Input and Output Handling', 'Error Handling and Robustness', 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'Library and API Usage', 'Testing and Debugging', 'Documentation and Readability', 'Security and Privacy', 'Reproducibility and Consistency']","simplified_instruction":"Design a Django database migration that creates a new model `ClassRoom`.

We define the models in `models.py`. Each model represents a table in the database and has fields that correspond to the columns in the table.\n2.  In `admin.py`, we import the necessary modules and define the admin classes for each model. Each admin class customizes the admin interface for the corresponding model.\n3.  We use the `list_display` attribute to specify the fields that should be displayed in the list view of the admin interface. This allows users to easily view and manage the data in the database.\n4.  We use the `search_fields` attribute to enable search functionality in the admin interface. This allows users to search for specific data in the database based on the fields specified.\n5.  We use the `list_filter` attribute to add filters to the admin interface. This allows users to filter the data in the database based on specific criteria.\n6.  Finally, we register the admin classes with the Django admin site using the `admin.site.register()` function.\n\nTo test the admin interface, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Run the following commands in your terminal to create the database tables and migrate the changes:\n\n    ```bash\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n2.  Create a superuser to access the admin interface:\n\n    ```bash\npython manage.py createsuperuser\n```\n3.  Run the development server:\n\n    ```bash\npython manage.py runserver\n```\n4.  Open a web browser and navigate to `http:\/\/localhost:8000\/admin\/` to access the admin interface.\n5.  Log in with the superuser credentials you created earlier.\n6.  Verify that the admin interface displays all required fields correctly for each model.\n7.  Test the search functionality by searching for specific data in the database based on the fields specified in the `search_fields` attribute.\n8.  Test the filters by applying filters to the data in the database based on the criteria specified in the `list_filter` attribute.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the admin interface is user-friendly and provides the necessary functionalities as described.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"Each model should have a corresponding admin class that customizes the admin interface.\", \"Reason\": \"The response defines admin classes for Author, Category, Post, and Comment models with customizations.

It should be able to download input data for a given year and day of the event. This means the program must be capable of handling requests for specific days within the event's timeline.\n2. The input data should be saved to a local file in a directory structure that follows the pattern `year\/day\/input.txt`. This ensures that the files are organized and easily accessible.\n3.

The food collision check compares snake_positions[-1] (a tuple) with food.position() (a tuple of floats), which may cause issues due to coordinate precision.

It then loads the JSON file and extracts the list of all categories. It creates a tensor of size 80 and sets the weights for seen categories to 1.0 and the weights for unseen categories to 0.0. The function returns the weight tensor.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the JSON file has the expected structure and that the category IDs are unique. If the JSON file has a different structure or if the category IDs are not unique, the function may not work as expected.\n\nAlso, this function uses the `torch.zeros` function to create a tensor of size 80. This function returns a tensor filled with zeros. If you want to use a different initialization method, you can replace this line with the desired initialization method.\n\nFinally, this function uses the `torch.index` method to set the weights for seen and unseen categories. This method returns the index of the element in the tensor that corresponds to the given category ID. If the category ID is not found in the tensor, this method raises a `ValueError`. To handle this case, you can use a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` exception and set the weight to 0.0 or 1.0 accordingly.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"The function should be named `generate_zero_shot_weights`.\", \"Reason\": \"The function is defined with the exact name `generate_zero_shot_weights`.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The function should take two lists of categories: `categories_seen` and `categories_unseen`.\", \"Reason\": \"The function signature includes `categories_seen` and `categories_unseen` as parameters, both expected to be lists.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The function should take a path to a JSON file containing category information as `category_info_path`.\", \"Reason\": \"The function takes `category_info_path` as a parameter, which is used to load the JSON file.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The function should generate a weight mask for zero-shot learning settings.\", \"Reason\": \"The function creates a tensor of weights where seen categories are set to 1.0 and unseen categories to 0.0, which constitutes a weight mask for zero-shot learning.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Weights for seen categories should be set to 1.0.\", \"Reason\": \"The function sets weights for categories in `categories_seen` to 1.0 in the tensor.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Weights for unseen categories should be set to 0.0.\", \"Reason\": \"The function explicitly sets weights for categories in `categories_unseen` to 0.0 in the tensor.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The JSON file at `category_info_path` should have a specific structure.\", \"Reason\": \"The function expects the JSON file to contain a 'categories' key with a list of dictionaries each having 'id' and 'name' keys, matching the specified structure.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The function should return a PyTorch tensor of size 80.\", \"Reason\": \"The function creates and returns a tensor of size 80 using `torch.zeros(80)`.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Each element of the tensor should correspond to a category ID from the JSON file.\", \"Reason\": \"The tensor elements correspond to the index of category IDs in the list extracted from the JSON file, so each element corresponds to a category ID.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The tensor should contain 1.0 for categories that are in `categories_seen`.\", \"Reason\": \"The function sets the tensor elements corresponding to seen categories to 1.0.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The tensor should contain 0.0 for categories that are in `categories_unseen`.\", \"Reason\": \"The function sets the tensor elements corresponding to unseen categories to 0.0.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The function should handle cases where the JSON file does not exist or is not accessible, raising an appropriate error.\", \"Reason\": \"The function checks if the file exists and raises FileNotFoundError if not.

an e-commerce system. The service interacts with other microservices for wallet balance checks, order creation, and escrow service for payment holding. It also communicates with a RabbitMQ message broker to publish messages about order status, errors, and notifications.\n\nThe service exposes an endpoint `\/place_order` that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing the order details. The service validates the incoming JSON payload for the required order fields and checks the user's wallet balance from the wallet microservice. If the balance is sufficient, it deducts the final price from the wallet and updates the order status to \"pending\". It then creates the order using the order microservice and creates an escrow record using the escrow microservice.\n\nThe service handles any exceptions and errors gracefully, providing meaningful responses and publishing error messages to RabbitMQ when necessary. It uses the `requests` library to interact with other microservices and the `pika` library to communicate with RabbitMQ.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nTo test the service, you can use a tool like `curl` to send a POST request to the `\/place_order` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the order details:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application\/json\" -d '{\"user_id\": 1, \"product_id\": 1, \"quantity\": 2, \"final_price\": 10.99}' http:\/\/localhost:5000\/place_order\n```\nThis should return a JSON response with the order ID and escrow ID:\n```json\n{\n  \"order_id\": 1,\n  \"escrow_id\": 1\n}\n```\nYou can also use a tool like `rabbitmqctl` to verify that the order status update and notification messages were published to RabbitMQ:\n```bash\nrabbitmqctl list_queues\n```\nThis should show the queues with the order status update and notification messages:\n```bash\nListing queues ...\norder_status_update  1\nnotification  1\n```\nNote that this is just an example use case, and you should modify the code to fit your specific use case and requirements.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"The microservice should expose an endpoint `\/place_order` that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing the order details.\", \"Reason\": \"The code defines a Flask route `\/place_order` that accepts POST requests and processes JSON payloads containing order details.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Validate the incoming JSON payload for the required order fields.\", \"Reason\": \"The function `validate_order_payload` checks for the presence of required fields ('user_id', 'product_id', 'quantity', 'final_price') in the JSON payload before proceeding.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Check the user's wallet balance from the wallet microservice.\", \"Reason\": \"The function `check_wallet_balance` makes a GET request to the wallet microservice API endpoint to retrieve the user's balance and compares it to the final price.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"If the balance is sufficient, deduct the final price from the wallet and update the order status to 'pending'.\", \"Reason\": \"The code checks if the balance is sufficient but does not explicitly show a deduction call to the wallet microservice to deduct the final price.

It first creates sets of students who have lost their uniforms and those who have brought an extra uniform. Then, it iterates over the students who have lost their uniforms and checks if they can borrow a uniform from the student before or after them. If a student can borrow a uniform, it removes the student from the reserve set. If a student cannot borrow a uniform, it decrements the maximum number of participants. Finally, it returns the maximum number of students who can participate.\n\nThe test cases cover various scenarios, including all students losing uniforms, all students having reserves, and edge cases where the 'lost' or 'reserve' lists are empty.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"The function should take three parameters: n (int), lost (list of int), and reserve (list of int).\", \"Reason\": \"The function definition is `def solution(n, lost, reserve):` which matches the required parameters exactly.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The function should return an integer.\", \"Reason\": \"The function returns `max_participants`, which is an integer representing the maximum number of students who can participate.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"A student can only borrow a uniform from a student whose number is either immediately before or after their own number.\", \"Reason\": \"The code checks if `student - 1` or `student + 1` is in the reserve set before lending a uniform, enforcing the borrowing condition.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The function should handle cases where the 'lost' or 'reserve' lists are empty without raising an error.\", \"Reason\": \"The function converts `lost` and `reserve` to sets and iterates over `lost_set`.

The asynchronous function 'get_weather' is defined but never properly awaited or run in an event loop, so the code will not run as intended. Additionally, the CLI argument parsing expects the city as a positional argument, but the usage example shows the city after the API key option, which is inconsistent.

Also, the mask handling is simplistic (multiplying input by mask) and does not properly handle masking in pooling operations.

Semantically, the AsyncRavenClient class incorrectly instantiates HTTPTransport with parameters that do not match its constructor, and the captureMessage method does not properly send messages asynchronously using Tornado's AsyncHTTPClient. The unit tests attempt to check asynchronous behavior but do not mock or patch AsyncHTTPClient properly, leading to likely failures. Additionally, the tests use unittest assertions inside callbacks without proper asynchronous test handling, which is not compatible with Tornado's AsyncTestCase. Therefore, the code is neither syntactically correct nor semantically correct, and it does not satisfy the constraints of asynchronous sending and proper testing using Tornado's framework."}

The class uses the provided `DenseNetEncoder` and `ResNetEncoder` classes to perform the feature extraction. The `extract_features` method takes a batch of images as input, normalizes them, moves them to the GPU if available, extracts features from the batch of images, and returns the extracted features as a dictionary.\n\nThe `DenseNetEncoder` and `ResNetEncoder` classes define the DenseNet and ResNet encoders, respectively. They inherit from the `torch.nn.Module` class and define the forward pass of the encoders using the `forward` method.\n\nTo use this code, you can create an instance of the `FeatureExtractor` class, passing the architecture and whether to use a pre-trained model or not as arguments. You can then call the `extract_features` method to extract features from a batch of images.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\n# Create a FeatureExtractor instance\nfeature_extractor = FeatureExtractor('densenet', use_pretrained=True)\n\n# Create a batch of images\nbatch_images = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)\n\n# Extract features from the batch of images\nfeatures = feature_extractor.extract_features(batch_images)\n\n# Print the extracted features\nprint(features)\n```\nThis code creates a `FeatureExtractor` instance using the DenseNet architecture and a pre-trained model. It then creates a batch of images and extracts features from the batch using the `extract_features` method. Finally, it prints the extracted features.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"The class should be named `FeatureExtractor`.\", \"Reason\": \"The provided code defines a class named `FeatureExtractor` as required.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The class should initialize with a choice of architecture (`'densenet'` or `'resnet'`) and whether to use a pre-trained model or not.\", \"Reason\": \"The `__init__` method of `FeatureExtractor` accepts `architecture` and `use_pretrained` parameters and uses them to initialize the encoder accordingly.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The method `extract_features` should take a batch of images as input.\", \"Reason\": \"The `extract_features` method takes `batch_images` as input, which is a batch of images represented as a torch.Tensor.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The method `extract_features` should return the extracted features.\", \"Reason\": \"The `extract_features` method returns the variable `features` which holds the output of the encoder, representing the extracted features.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The method should handle the input images correctly (e.g., normalizing them if required by the model).\", \"Reason\": \"The method normalizes the input images using torchvision.transforms.Normalize with mean and std values appropriate for ImageNet pretrained models before feature extraction.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The class should use the provided `DenseNetEncoder` and `ResNetEncoder` classes to perform the feature extraction.\", \"Reason\": \"The `FeatureExtractor` class initializes and uses `DenseNetEncoder` or `ResNetEncoder` instances for feature extraction as per the architecture choice.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `extract_features` method should return a dictionary where the keys are the names of the feature sets and the values are the corresponding feature tensors.\", \"Reason\": \"The method returns `features` which is the direct output of the encoder's forward method.

The `QuixoBoard` class represents the game board and handles player moves, checking for winning conditions, and displaying the board. The `AlphaBetaAI` class implements the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to determine the best move for the AI player.\n\nIn the `main` function, the game loop continues until a player wins or a draw occurs. The AI player uses the Alpha-Beta algorithm to determine its moves, and the human player inputs their moves by specifying the piece to move and the target position. The game checks for a winning condition after each move and announces the winner or a draw when the game ends.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"Initialize a 5x5 Quixo board with numbered pieces that can be moved by players.\", \"Reason\": \"The QuixoBoard class initializes a 5x5 board with pieces numbered 1 to 25 arranged in a grid, fulfilling the requirement to initialize a board with numbered pieces.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Allow the AI to make a move by sliding a piece from the edge of the board to an empty space or a space containing one of its tokens.\", \"Reason\": \"The AI attempts moves by calling make_move with positions i and i+5 or i-5, but the logic for sliding pieces from the edge to valid positions is not clearly implemented or validated.

The determinant should be printed as an integer without any decimal places.","extracted_constraints":"[{'type': 'Input and Output Handling', 'constraint': 'The user must provide a positive integer `n`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Construct the adjacency matrix `A` of size `n x n`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Set the diagonal entries of the matrix to `3`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Set the entries corresponding to edges to `-1`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Use Gaussian elimination without pivoting to calculate the determinant.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Output Handling', 'constraint': 'Print the determinant as an integer without any decimal places.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}]","final_comprehensive_constraints":"[{'type': 'Input and Output Handling', 'constraint': 'The user must provide a positive integer `n`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Construct the adjacency matrix `A` of size `n x n`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Set the diagonal entries of the matrix to `3`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Set the entries corresponding to edges to `-1`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Use Gaussian elimination without pivoting to calculate the determinant.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Output Handling', 'constraint': 'Print the determinant as an integer without any decimal places.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Error Handling and Robustness', 'constraint': 'The program must handle non-integer inputs gracefully by prompting the user to enter a valid positive integer.', 'instruction_part': 'Newly Generated'}, {'type': 'Error Handling and Robustness', 'constraint': 'The program must handle cases where `n` is less than 1 by displaying an appropriate error message.', 'instruction_part': 'Newly Generated'}, {'type': 'Testing and Debugging', 'constraint': 'Include unit tests for the `calculate_determinant` function to verify correctness for various values of `n`.', 'instruction_part': 'Newly Generated'}, {'type': 'Documentation and Readability', 'constraint': 'Provide docstrings for all functions, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.', 'instruction_part': 'Newly Generated'}, {'type': 'Performance and Optimization', 'constraint': 'Optimize the Gaussian elimination process to minimize the number of operations performed on the matrix.', 'instruction_part': 'Newly Generated'}]","filtered_relevant_constraints":"[{'type': 'Input and Output Handling', 'constraint': 'The user must provide a positive integer `n`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Construct the adjacency matrix `A` of size `n x n`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Set the diagonal entries of the matrix to `3`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Set the entries corresponding to edges to `-1`.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'constraint': 'Use Gaussian elimination without pivoting to calculate the determinant.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Mathematical Computation', 'constraint': 'Print the determinant as an integer without any decimal places.', 'instruction_part': 'Extracted from instruction'}, {'type': 'Error Handling and Robustness', 'constraint': 'The program must handle non-integer inputs gracefully by prompting the user to enter a valid positive integer.', 'instruction_part': 'Newly Generated'}, {'type': 'Error Handling and Robustness', 'constraint': 'The program must handle cases where `n` is less than 1 by displaying an appropriate error message.', 'instruction_part': 'Newly Generated'}]","quality_scores":"{'constraint_evaluations': [{'constraint_text': 'The user must provide a positive integer `n`.', 'atomicity_score': 5, 'relevance_score': 5, 'objectivity_score': 5, 'reasoning': 'This constraint is atomic as it expresses a single requirement regarding user input.

The `scrape_airfield_data` function sends a GET request to the specified URL, parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup, and extracts the airfield data from the table.\n2. The `process_airfield_data` function processes the scraped data by:\n\t* Title-casing airfield names\n\t* Capitalizing status fields\n\t* Converting altitude, magnetic orientation, and ground level to numeric types\n\t* Splitting geographic coordinates, runway orientations, and positions into separate components\n\t* Parsing and separating runway surface details into length, width, and surface type\n3. The `save_to_json` function saves the processed data to a JSON file with a structured format.\n4. The `main` function orchestrates the entire process by scraping the airfield data, processing it, and saving it to a JSON file.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nAssuming the URL `https:\/\/example.com\/airfield-data` contains the following HTML table:\n\n| Code | Name | Magnetic Orientation | Geographic Coordinates | Altitude | Traffic | Ground Level | Status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ABC | New York | 123.45 | 40.7128, -74.0060 | 100 | High | 500 | Active |\n| DEF | Los Angeles | 234.56 | 34.0522, -118.2437 | 200 | Low | 1000 | Inactive |\n\nThe program will scrape the data, process it, and save it to a JSON file named `airfield_data.json` with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"ABC\",\n    \"name\": \"New York\",\n    \"magnetic_orientation\": 123.45,\n    \"geographic_coordinates\": {\n      \"latitude\": 40.7128,\n      \"longitude\": -74.0060\n    },\n    \"altitude\": 100.0,\n    \"traffic\": \"High\",\n    \"ground_level\": 500.0,\n    \"status\": \"Active\",\n    \"runways\": [\n      {\n        \"surface_type\": \"Grass\",\n        \"orientation\": 45.0,\n        \"threshold_positions\": [\"10\", \"20\"],\n        \"altitudes\": [\"100\", \"200\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"code\": \"DEF\",\n    \"name\": \"Los Angeles\",\n    \"magnetic_orientation\": 234.56,\n    \"geographic_coordinates\": {\n      \"latitude\": 34.0522,\n      \"longitude\": -118.2437\n    },\n    \"altitude\": 200.0,\n    \"traffic\": \"Low\",\n    \"ground_level\": 1000.0,\n    \"status\": \"Inactive\",\n    \"runways\": [\n      {\n        \"surface_type\": \"Asphalt\",\n        \"orientation\": 90.0,\n        \"threshold_positions\": [\"30\", \"40\"],\n        \"altitudes\": [\"300\", \"400\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"Title-case airfield names.\", \"Reason\": \"The response explicitly applies the .title() method to airfield names in the process_airfield_data function, satisfying the constraint.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Capitalize status fields.\", \"Reason\": \"The response capitalizes the status field using .capitalize() when scraping the data, meeting the requirement.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Convert altitude, magnetic orientation, and ground level to appropriate numeric types.\", \"Reason\": \"The response converts altitude, magnetic_orientation, and ground_level to float types in process_airfield_data, fulfilling the constraint.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Split geographic coordinates, runway orientations, and positions into separate components.\", \"Reason\": \"Geographic coordinates are split into latitude and longitude floats.

A method `encode_sentences` that should take a list of source sentences (`src_sentences`) and an optional list of target sentences (`tgt_sentences`).

`encrypt` and `decrypt` functions are used to encrypt and decrypt the values.\n*   The `get_value` method returns the decrypted value, and the `get_typed_value` method returns the decrypted value in its original data type.\n*   The `test_secure_string`, `test_secure_decimal`, `test_secure_date`, `test_secure_datetime`, and `test_secure_incomplete_date` test cases verify that the secure data types work correctly.\n*   The `test_access_denied` test case checks that access is denied when the access level is not \"admin\".\n*   The `test_invalid_data_type` test case checks that a `ValueError` is

The `Contact` model includes validation to ensure that the `phone_number` field cannot be empty.\n- We override the `deconstruct` method to ensure that the `max_length` argument is not included in the field's definition.\n- We override the `formfield` method to ensure that the `widget` is set to the default `CharField` widget.\n- We override the `to_python`, `get_prep_value`, `value_to_string`, and `value_from_object` methods to ensure that the field behaves correctly when serializing and deserializing data.\n- We override the `formfield_callback` method to ensure that the field behaves correctly when rendering forms.\n\nYou can use the `PhoneField` in your models like any other field.

The `depth` argument keeps track of the current depth of the nested list structure.\n\nThe `depthSum` function initializes the `total` variable to 0 and then iterates over each item in the `nestedList`.

We'll use Django's built-in `models` module to create a `Polygon` model.\n\n```python\n# models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Polygon(models.Model):\n    num_sides = models.IntegerField()\n    sides = models.JSONField()\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Polygon with {self.num_sides} sides\"\n\n    @property\n    def polygon_type(self):\n        if

   else:\n            return f\"{self.num_sides}-gon\"\n```\n\n### Views\n\nNext, we'll define the views that handle the API requests.\n\n```python\n# views.py\nfrom rest_framework.response import Response\nfrom rest_framework.views import APIView\nfrom rest_framework import status\nfrom .models import Polygon\nfrom .serializers import PolygonSerializer\nfrom django.http import Http404\n\nclass PolygonDetailView(APIView):\n    def get(self, request, pk):\n        try:\n            polygon = Polygon.objects.get(pk=pk)\n        except Polygon.DoesNotExist:\n            raise Http404\n

status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)\n```\n\n### Serializers\n\nWe'll use Django's built-in `serializers` module to define a serializer for the `Polygon` model.\n\n```python\n# serializers.py\nfrom rest_framework import serializers\nfrom .models import Polygon\n\nclass PolygonSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Polygon\n        fields = ['id', 'num_sides', 'polygon_type', 'sides']\n```\n\n### URL Configuration\n\nFinally, we'll define the URL configuration for the API endpoints.\n\n```python\n# urls.py\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom .views import PolygonDetailView, PolygonListView\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('polygone\/polygoneinfo\/<int:pk>\/', PolygonDetailView.as_view()),\n    path('polygone\/polygoneinfo\/', PolygonListView.as_view()),\n    path('polygone\/polygonecreate\/', PolygonListView.as_view(), name='polygon-create'),\n]\n```\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nTo protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks, we'll use Django's built-in security features:\n\n*   We'll use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n*   We'll use Django's built-in template engine to prevent XSS attacks.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nWe'll write test cases to verify the correctness of the API endpoints.\n\n```python\n# tests.py\nfrom django.test import TestCase, Client\nfrom rest_framework.test import APITestCase\nfrom .models import

You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npip install graphene-django\n```\n\nNext, you need to create a Django application and a model for the Coupon. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\n# models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Coupon(models.Model):\n    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\n    code = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n    valid_from = models.DateTimeField()\n    valid_to = models.DateTimeField()\n    discount = models.FloatField()\n    active = models.BooleanField(default=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.code\n```\n\nNext, you need to create a GraphQL schema using the Graphene library. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\n# schema.py\nimport graphene\nfrom graphene_django import DjangoObjectType\nfrom .models import Coupon\n\nclass CouponType(DjangoObjectType):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Coupon\n        fields = ('id', 'code', 'valid_from', 'valid_to', 'discount', 'active')\n\nclass Query(graphene.ObjectType):\n    all_coupons = graphene.List(CouponType)\n    get_coupon = graphene.Field(CouponType, id=graphene.ID())\n\n    def resolve_all_coupons(self, info):\n        return Coupon.objects.all()\n\n    def resolve_get_coupon(self, info, id):\n        try:\n            return Coupon.objects.get(id=id)\n        except Coupon.DoesNotExist:\n            return None\n\nschema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)\n```\n\nIn the above code, we've defined a `CouponType` that represents the `Coupon` model. We've also defined a `Query` object that contains two fields: `all_coupons` and `get_coupon`.\n\nThe `all_coupons` field returns a list of all coupons using the `resolve_all_coupons` method, which simply queries the `Coupon` model using Django's ORM.\n\nThe `get_coupon` field returns the details of a single coupon using the `resolve_get_coupon` method, which takes an `id` argument and uses Django's ORM to retrieve the coupon with the matching id. If the coupon does not exist, it returns `None`.\n\nFinally, you need to create a GraphQL view that will handle incoming GraphQL queries. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\n# views.py\nfrom django.views.decorators.http import require_http_methods\nfrom graphene_django.views import GraphQLView\nfrom .schema import schema\n\n@require_http_methods(['GET', 'POST'])\ndef graphql_view(request):\n    return GraphQLView.as_view(schema=schema)(request)\n```\n\nIn the above code, we've defined a `graphql_view` function that will handle incoming GraphQL queries. This function uses the `GraphQLView` class from `graphene_django` to create a GraphQL view that will handle incoming queries.\n\nYou can then add this view to your Django URL configuration like this:\n\n```python\n# urls.py\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom .views import graphql_view\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('graphql\/', graphql_view),\n]\n```\n\nWith this setup, you can now query your GraphQL API using a tool like GraphiQL or by sending a POST request to the `\/graphql\/` endpoint with a JSON payload containing your GraphQL query.\n\nHere's an example of how you can query the `allCoupons` field:\n\n```bash\nquery {\n  allCoupons {\n    id\n    code\n    validFrom\n    validTo\n    discount\n    active\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of how you can query the `getCoupon` field:\n\n```bash\nquery {\n  getCoupon(id: 1) {\n    id\n    code\n    validFrom\n    validTo\n    discount\n    active\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that if the coupon with the given id does not exist, the `getCoupon` field will return `null`.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"Use Python's Graphene library to design the GraphQL API.\", \"Reason\": \"The response uses the 'graphene' and 'graphene_django' libraries to define the GraphQL schema, types, and queries, fulfilling the requirement to use Python's Graphene library.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The API should be built on top of a Django application.\", \"Reason\": \"The response includes Django model definition, Django views, and URL configuration, indicating the API is built on top of a Django application.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `Coupon` model must have fields: id, code, valid_from, valid_to, discount, and active.\", \"Reason\": \"The provided Django model 'Coupon' defines all the required fields with correct types: id (AutoField primary key), code (CharField), valid_from (DateTimeField), valid_to (DateTimeField), discount (FloatField), and active (BooleanField).\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The API should provide a query `allCoupons` that returns a list of all coupons with their id, code, valid_from, valid_to, discount, and active status.\", \"Reason\": \"The GraphQL schema defines a query field named 'all_coupons' (note the underscore) that returns a list of CouponType objects including all required fields.

The only minor issue is that the GraphQL query examples use camelCase field names (validFrom, validTo) which do not match the snake_case field names defined in the schema (valid_from, valid_to), but this is a common Graphene behavior (auto camelCase conversion) and does not affect correctness. Therefore, all constraints are satisfied and the code is completely correct."}

It then uses a binary search algorithm to find the maximum amount of FUEL that can be produced with 1 trillion units of ORE.\n\nThe `read_reactions` function reads the reaction definitions from the file and stores them in a dictionary. Each reaction is represented as a dictionary with two keys: `inputs` and `outputs`. The `inputs` dictionary maps each input chemical to its corresponding amount, and the `outputs` dictionary maps the output chemical to its corresponding amount.\n\nThe `calculate_max_fuel` function performs the binary search. It initializes the search range to the entire range of possible FUEL amounts (from 0 to 1 trillion). It then repeatedly performs reactions until it runs out of FUEL or ORE. If it runs out of FUEL, it increases the search range. If it doesn't run out of FUEL, it decreases the search range. The function returns the maximum amount of FUEL that can be produced.\n\n### Example Use Case\n\nSuppose the `transformations.txt` file contains the following reaction definitions:\n\n```\n7 A, 1 B => 1 C\n3 C, 4 D => 1 E\n2 E, 2 F => 1 G\n```\n\nThe program will output the maximum amount of FUEL that can be produced with 1 trillion units of ORE.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"Read the reaction definitions from `transformations.txt`.\", \"Reason\": \"The response includes a function `read_reactions` that attempts to open and read from `transformations.txt` and parse its contents.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Determine the maximum amount of FUEL that can be produced using exactly 1 trillion (1,000,000,000,000) units of ORE.\", \"Reason\": \"The response defines a function `calculate_max_fuel` that aims to compute the maximum FUEL producible with a given ORE limit of 1 trillion, and the main program calls this function with 1 trillion as the ORE limit.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Implement a binary search algorithm to find the maximum amount of FUEL.\", \"Reason\": \"The `calculate_max_fuel` function uses variables `low`, `high`, and `mid` and a while loop to perform a binary search over the amount of FUEL, adjusting the search range based on resource availability.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Ensure that the program correctly parses and transforms the input data into a usable format for calculations.\", \"Reason\": \"The parsing logic in `read_reactions` uses a regex that only matches lines with exactly two inputs and one output, which is not general enough for arbitrary reaction lines.

The code mistakenly overwrites the question's author ID with the answer's author ID in the final mapping, which is semantically incorrect.

Semantically, the code attempts to measure the time taken per request but incorrectly calculates the request duration in make_request by returning time.time() - time.time(), which always results in zero. Also, exceptions raised in make_request are not caught in simulate_requests, so error messages are not printed as required. The total time measurement is done around the future.result() calls, which measures the time to collect results rather than the actual request durations. The code uses a thread pool with configurable workers and includes a main section as required. However, it fails to correctly measure and print per-request times and does not handle exceptions by printing error messages, violating the instruction constraints. Therefore, it is partially correct."}

two factory classes: `TaskQueueFactory` and `TaskQueueServerFactory`. Each factory class is responsible for creating and configuring its respective components based on the provided settings section.\n\nThe `TaskQueueFactory` class creates and registers a task queue utility, while the `TaskQueueServerFactory` class creates and registers a task queue server.\n\nWe also define a settings loader class to load settings from a file and a settings override class to override settings from environment variables.\n\nIn the example usage, we load settings from a file, override settings from environment variables, create a task queue factory, create a task queue, and create a task queue server factory.\n\nNote that this is a basic example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to implement the `create_queue` and `create_server` methods in the queue and server modules, respectively.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement the `create_queue` and `create_server` methods in the queue and server modules:\n\n```python\n# queue.py\nimport redis\n\nclass Queue:\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.config = config\n        self.redis = redis.Redis(host=config['host'], port=config['port'], db=config['db'])\n\n    def create_queue(self):\n        return self\n\n# server.py\nimport redis\n\nclass Server:\n    def __init__(self, config):\n        self.config = config\n        self.redis = redis.Redis(host=config['host'], port=config['port'], db=config['db'])\n\n    def create_server(self):\n        return self\n```\n\nYou can then import the queue and server modules in the factory classes and use them to create the task queue and server:\n\n```python\n# task_queue_factory.py\nimport queue\n\nclass TaskQueueFactory:\n    def create_queue(self):\n        queue_type = self.settings.get('queue_type')\n        queue_config = self.settings.get('queue_config')\n\n        # Import the queue module\n        queue_module = importlib.import_module(queue_type)\n\n        # Create and register the task queue utility\n        queue = queue_module.Queue(queue_config)\n        self.queues[queue_type] = queue\n        return queue\n\n# task_queue_server_factory.py\nimport server\n\nclass TaskQueueServerFactory:\n    def create_server(self):\n        server_type = self.settings.get('server_type')\n        server_config = self.settings.get('server_config')\n\n        # Import the server module\n        server_module = importlib.import_module(server_type)\n\n        # Create and register the task queue server\n        server = server_module.Server(server_config)\n        self.servers[server_type] = server\n        return server\n```","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"The system should consist of two main factory classes: `TaskQueueFactory` and `TaskQueueServerFactory`.\", \"Reason\": \"The response defines two main factory classes named `TaskQueueFactory` and `TaskQueueServerFactory` as required.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `TaskQueueFactory` class should accept a settings section with queue configuration details.\", \"Reason\": \"The `TaskQueueFactory` class constructor accepts a `Settings` object which holds configuration details, including queue configuration.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `TaskQueueFactory` class should validate that the required packages for the specified queue type are installed.\", \"Reason\": \"The `create_queue` method uses `pkg_resources.require(queue_type)` inside a try-except block to validate package installation and logs an error if not found.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `TaskQueueFactory` class should create and register a task queue utility.\", \"Reason\": \"The `create_queue` method imports the queue module dynamically and creates a queue instance which is stored in the `self.queues` dictionary, thus registering it.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `TaskQueueServerFactory` class should accept a settings section with server configuration details.\", \"Reason\": \"The `TaskQueueServerFactory` constructor accepts a `Settings` object which contains server configuration details.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `TaskQueueServerFactory` class should validate that the required packages for the specified queue type are installed.\", \"Reason\": \"The `create_server` method uses `pkg_resources.require(server_type)` inside a try-except block to validate package installation and logs an error if not found.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `TaskQueueServerFactory` class should create and register a task queue server.\", \"Reason\": \"The `create_server` method imports the server module dynamically and creates a server instance which is stored in the `self.servers` dictionary, thus registering it.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Both classes should support additional configuration for debugging purposes, such as setting IP and port information.\", \"Reason\": \"The response does not explicitly show handling or support for additional debugging configuration such as IP and port settings within the factory classes or settings.

adding the `CAPABILITY_IMPORT` and `CAPABILITY_EXPORT` capabilities. The `PluginManager` class manages different versions of plugins, ensuring that each plugin version has a unique identifier. It provides methods to register plugins, get a plugin by its version identifier, and list all registered plugins along with their capabilities. The code includes error handling for cases where a plugin version is not found or an attempt is made to register a plugin with an existing version identifier.","constraint_adherence_responses":"{\"Evaluation\": [{\"Constraint\": \"The `PluginManager` should be able to register multiple versions of plugins.\", \"Reason\": \"The `PluginManager` class has a `register_plugin` method that adds plugins to a dictionary keyed by their version, allowing multiple plugin versions to be registered.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Each plugin version should have a unique identifier.\", \"Reason\": \"Each plugin instance has a `version` attribute used as a unique key in the `PluginManager`'s `plugins` dictionary, ensuring uniqueness.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `PluginManager` should provide a method to get a plugin by its version identifier.\", \"Reason\": \"The `get_plugin` method in `PluginManager` retrieves a plugin by its version identifier.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `PluginManager` should provide a method to list all registered plugins along with their capabilities.\", \"Reason\": \"The `list_plugins` method returns a dictionary mapping plugin versions to their capabilities.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Implement error handling for cases where a plugin version is not found.\", \"Reason\": \"The `get_plugin` method raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message if the requested plugin version is not found.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"Use the provided `Plugin_v1` class as a base class for creating a new plugin version `Plugin_v2`.\", \"Reason\": \"`Plugin_v2` inherits from `Plugin_v1` as shown in the class definition.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `Plugin_v2` should override the `capabilities` method to return its new capabilities.\", \"Reason\": \"`Plugin_v2` overrides the `capabilities` method to return its capabilities set, which includes the added import and export capabilities.\", \"Aligns\": true}, {\"Constraint\": \"The `PluginManager` should raise a descriptive exception if an attempt is made to register a plugin with an existing version identifier.\", \"Reason\": \"The `register_plugin` method raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message if a plugin with the same version is already registered.\", \"Aligns\": true}]}","Constraint_adherence":[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],"correctness_level":"Completely Correct","correctness_reason":"The code is syntactically correct and logically implements the PluginManager and plugin versions as instructed.
