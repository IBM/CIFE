Then, we initialize a counter variable `count` to keep track of the number of characters we have iterated through. We iterate through each character in the word using a for loop, incrementing the counter at each iteration. When the counter reaches 3, we return the corresponding character.","test":null,"relevant_categories":"['Code Structure and Modularity', 'Input and Output Handling', 'Error Handling and Robustness', 'Data Processing and Transformation', 'Testing and Debugging', 'Documentation and Readability']","simplified_instruction":"Given a string ``word``, write code to return the third character in the string using a single loop iteration and without using any built-in functions or libraries.
